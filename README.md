dotfiles
========

These are all of my personal configurations for my various work stations.


Installation
========

From within the home directory: 

```shell
mkdir .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
git clone https://github.com:HowdyDutty/dotfiles.git
sh install.sh
```

Uninstallation
========

If you are ever fed up with my dotfiles, you can uninstall them...

From within the .dotfiles directory:

```shell
sh uninstall.sh
```

And that's it!
