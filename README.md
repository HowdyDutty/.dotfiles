dotfiles
========

These are all of my personal configurations for my various work stations.


Installation
========

From within the home directory: 

```shell
git clone git@github.com:HowdyDutty/.dotfiles.git
cd .dotfiles
sh install.sh
```

Uninstallation
========

If you are ever fed up with my dotfiles, you can uninstall them...

From within the .dotfiles directory:

```shell
sh uninstall.sh
```

And that's it!

Personal Preferences
========

On Windows:

I use a fairly new terminal emulator that's still in it's early stages of development. It's called  [babun](https://github.com/babun/babun) and it's awesome!


On OS X:

This is already in the auto installer, but I think it's worth mentioning. 

[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) is great. It allows for a lot of customization and has a huge followng. I enjoy it.
